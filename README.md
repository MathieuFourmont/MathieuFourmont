# Hi there 👋

I'm Mathieu, a 33 yo student at [École 42 Lyon](https://42lyon.fr/).

After a Master degree and 10 years doing financial controlling, I'm excited to procces my career transition. My game plan from now on: jumping into the world of cybersecurity gigs!  

At École 42, the education model focuses on project-based learning and teamwork, rather than theoritical education. 

Hence, during this journey, I learned C and C++ languages, as you can check with some projects here below:
- [minishell](https://github.com/Hevhove/minishell)
- [cub3D](https://github.com/MathieuFourmont/C_Cursus/tree/main/04_Cub3d)
